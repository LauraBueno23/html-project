                <p>I am a mother to a little boy and 2 dogs. My family is originally from Mexico. I am the 4th child out of 5. I was born and raised in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada also known as “Sin City”. I am the first in my family to graduate college with a certificate in Medical Assistant. I like going on hikes preferably on the trails at Mount Charleston. I am a foodie, love exploring different foods and exploring new places to eat. Fun fact about me is that I was a surrogate to a wonderful family and helped them bring their little boy in to their arms last year! It was a wonderful experience and am hoping to be able to do this again soon!
