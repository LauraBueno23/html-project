                <h2>Laura</h2>
                <p>I am a mother to a little boy and 2 dogs. My family is originally from Mexico. I am the 4th child out of 5. I was born and raised in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada also known as “Sin City”. I am the first in my family to graduate college with a certificate in Medical Assistant.

              <h4>Fun facts!</h4> 
              <p>I have rehomed 4 dogs in to new loving homes within the last few years. I was also a surrogate last year, I helped a loving family bring their little boy in to their arms and it was a wonderful experience by far! 
               
               <p>I love the medical field and have been trying to get back into this field since I left. I am hoping to get back into and stay in this field throughout the rest of my career, definitely in a different department then I originally intended. </p>
